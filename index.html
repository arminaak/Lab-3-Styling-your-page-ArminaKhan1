    <h3>All About CSS</h3> <!--I added this heading to make my webpage more organized.-->

    <p>CSS, also known as Cascading Style Sheets, is used to customize, decorate, and design your webpage to your liking. It is a crucial part of websites because it can attract different groups of audiences depending on how you customize the page. For instance, you can add bright colors to the site to attract younger age groups. Without CSS, you would have a blank white webpage with black text scattered on it. No matter how valuable the information you put may be, no one will be attracted to or want to read your website due to how boring it looks.

      There are 3 ways you can add CSS to your webpage: In line, Internal, and External. In-line CSS is when the code is inside the tag in the HTML document. In-line CSS is a good option and convenient when you want to only change a single element that can fall under the same category as another element. Internal CSS is when the code is inside the head in the HTML document. This is a convenient method for changing a certain type of element within a specific HTML document. Contrasting to the other two methods to add CSS, external CSS is when the coding is in another file, which can be a CSS file. These CSS files usually start off with the name "style.css". Using CSS files can make it easier for a web designer to see what they have changed within an HTML file, and to establish what they want to change. This is due to the fact that all your CSS edits are organized within this one file.</p>
